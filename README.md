# STEP 6: Refactoring and creating a more sophisticated application

Let's refactor our application so we can demonstrate a more complex application.

Many applications we build will need to support CRUD operations. CRUD stands for 

**C**reate: Creating something (POST)

**R**ead: Read something (GET)

**U**pdate: Update something (PUT/PATCH)

**D**elete: Delete something (DELETE)

Let's refactor our server to support these routes.
